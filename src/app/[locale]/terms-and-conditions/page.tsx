                            If the refund request is not within the above, we
                            will investigate the request on a case-by-case
                            basis. If the refund is approved, a processing fee
                            may apply. The maximum refund of credit a Customer
                            can apply for must be equal to or less than the
                            total amount they paid.

                    Depending on the nature of the issue, Customers will be
                    asked for further information to support their refund
                    request, such as screenshots of the device settings for
                    technical issues or details of why the invoiced amount is
                    incorrect and, if possible, how much the Customer considers
                    is due, etc. Please refer to section Policies and Guidelines
                    (Point 1) in this same document for refunds related to
                    technical issues. Customers will have the option to credit
                    back via their original payment method.

                    issued, it can take up to thirty (30) business days to
                    appear on a statement depending on the bank.
